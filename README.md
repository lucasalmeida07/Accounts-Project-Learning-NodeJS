# This project was made to exercise the use of some core modules and some external modules

## The idea is to simulate the use of a bank account, but very poorly

## The project was proposed in the course "NodeJS do Zero Ã  Maestria" from Matheus Battisti(https://github.com/matheusbattisti)

get the npm running and all the modules:

    npm init
    npm install

then just run the script:

    npm start
